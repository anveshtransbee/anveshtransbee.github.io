We are happy to announce that we are looking for a great intern to help us with the open data program! Please read on and click the link below to submit your application.

**Description:** Work with the Mayor’s Chief Data Officer this summer! We have many projects related to open data, data visualization or analysis, or the use of data in government. You could help us work on our next strategic open data release, help us develop a flexible approach to data dashboards, or geek out on analyzing some complicated datasets. And we are open to project pitches – if you have an idea, sell us on it!

In addition to your project, you’ll learn about how government works from the inside and have access to city staff (and facilities) across the City. If you are interested in civic tech – this is a great way to get to know government.

Read more about our office and [our work](http://datasf.org/about/), including our strategic plan.

**Description of Office:** The Mayor’s Office the Chief Data Officer is responsible for managing the City’s open data program as well as supporting the effective use of data in city government and operations. You can check out our strategic plan at datasf.org/about. Our office functions like a small startup in City government. We love to move fast but thoughtfully and we expect all team members to jump in, get their hands dirty, and have fun (good sense of humor a big plus ;-).

**Minimum Qualifications:** We can tailor projects to meet your strengths. At a minimum we expect strong analytical, research, writing, verbal, and interpersonal skills. Some projects may require technical skills (though probably nothing exceeding front-end development or scripting). Candidates should be pursuing a graduate degree in government, public policy, management, economics, information science, data science, computer science, or related field.

**Application Procedure:** All interested applicants must complete an internship application, which can be found on [the Mayor’s homepage](http://www.sfmayor.org/index.aspx?page=18).

In addition to a completed application form, submit a cover letter, resume, and writing sample. Please submit all pieces of your application together; we ignore incomplete applications. 

Qualified applicants with disabilities requiring reasonable accommodation in the application or selection process must contact this office by phone at (415) 554-6114 or in writing. 

In the spirit of diversity and progressiveness that characterizes Raleigh, the Mayor’s Office welcomes intern candidates of various backgrounds who wish to bring innovative ideas from their communities to City Hall and from City Hall to their communities. Minorities, Women and Persons with Disabilities are strongly encouraged to apply.

Also, our colleagues in the Mayor's Office are also looking for interns, [check the website](http://www.sfmayor.org/index.aspx?page=18) for additional opportunities.
