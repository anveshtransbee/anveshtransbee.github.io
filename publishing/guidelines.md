#Publishing Guidelines

We’ve created some guidelines for publishing data on [SF Open Data](https://data.sfgov.org). Following these guidelines will help maximize the value of publishing your data and support a consistent experience for our users.

##Publish data in the rawest form possible
One of the cool things about open data is that people are always surprising us by what they do with it. Publishing data in the rawest form possible helps make the data as flexible as possible.

For example, if you collect data on fruit and vegetable purchases, you could publish summarized or raw data. In the picture below, if you publish the raw data - you can derive the other two. Publishing your raw data is the best way to foster new uses! We understand, of course, your ability to publish in raw formats may be limited by legal and privacy constraints, so that’s why it's the rawest form **possible**.

##Include the dataset steward in the publishing process
Data stewards are responsible for the dataset and can answer questions about the data and help make decisions about how to publish it. You should not be publishing a dataset without input from the data steward. They are key to helping us actively manage and answer dataset questions. 

##Don’t publish data from another department
This is a corollary to the previous - if your department doesn’t manage the data, you should not publish it. Otherwise we won’t be able to effectively respond to data questions or ensure that the right or best data is being published. There may be occasions when multiple departments contribute to a single dataset, but we’ll handle these on a case by case basis.

##Publish address or point data in tabular format - not as a shapefile
Most users are confused by or don’t have the resources to use shapefiles. (Whereas our savvier users find it simple to go from tabular to mapped data). Tabular data makes it easier for most users to use. Plus, our open data platform allows us to create maps on top of the tabular view anyway. SF crime incident data, for example, [is published in this way](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/SFPD-Incidents-from-1-January-2014/tmnf-yvry) and users can make a bunch of maps from it, [like this one](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/West-Portal-Area/yani-faij). Overall, this increases the flexibility and usability of those point layer datasets.

##Publish non-point geographic data natively
Upload geographic lines or polygons so that they are hosted natively on the platform (versus a zipped shapefile). We are moving toward native hosting of all datasets to create a more consistent platform experience for users.

For less volatile datasets that change very little or are historical in nature, you can [upload the shapefile directly](https://support.socrata.com/hc/en-us/articles/202950488-Host-geospatial-files-using-Socrata-Mondara). For more complex, changing datasets, you can [load ESRI Map Layer links](https://support.socrata.com/hc/en-us/articles/202950498-Connect-an-ESRI-map-layer) to keep the dataset synced to a source mapping service.

##Publish data about geographic boundaries in keyed tables - not as a shapefile
If you have a dataset by a certain geography (e.g. neighborhood, tract or supervisor district) publish the data as a table using the geography as a key field. This will allow others to access the data regardless of GIS capabilities.

If your dataset is a novel analysis and includes a series of indicators, publish it as a single dataset and include documentation on the analysis. This will help signal to the user that this is an analysis dataset that represents a point in time and not a source for the original data. See [DPH’s Community Resiliency Indicator system](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://data.sfgov.org/Health-and-Social-Services/Community-Resiliency-Indicator-System/banc-xdvr) for an example of this.

##Automate data publishing where appropriate
In order to maintain timely data available across the City, we prefer automation and provide a set of services to help in the automation process. The best way to start publishing data is to fill out a Publisher Packet for the dataset completely. The information in this packet will help the open data team work with you to determine the most appropriate data publishing method. You can [read more about data automation]({{site.baseurl}}/publishing/automation) services, if you want to learn more about the options.
